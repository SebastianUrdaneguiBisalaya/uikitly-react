# `uikitly-react` Components

`uikitly-react` is a TypeScript library that provides two customizable react components inspired by GitHub's contribution tracker and status tracking chart. 
Both components support light and dark themes out of the box, allowing you to easily adapt them to your design preferences.

The goal of this library is to help developers save working hours by reusing ready-to-use, flexible table-based components.
